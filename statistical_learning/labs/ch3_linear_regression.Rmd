**Question #1:**  
What are the parameters of the binomial distribution for the probability of rolling either a 1 or a 20 on a 20-sided die, if we roll the die 12 times?  

**Answer #1:**  
Here, we are simply defining parameters k, n, and p for the situation described above.  

n: 12  
k: 1  
p: 2/20 = 1/10  

We can then use the code below to calculate the probability of this specific event:  

```{r q1 calc}
n = 12
k = 1
p = 1/10

probability = choose(n,k)*(p^k)*((1-p)^(n-k))
probability
```
